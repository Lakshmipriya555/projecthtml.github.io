                            <h1>Step 1: Learn Backend Development Technologies</h1>
                            <p>A key step in becoming a backend developer is learning programming languages. 

                                These significant programming languages are worth learning are as follows:</p>
                            <p>1.<b>Python:</b> is a well-liked programming language for creating backends> <br>
                                It is renowned for being straightforward, readable, and adaptable. <br> 
                                Python is frequently used to create online applications and for machine learning, data analysis, and scientific computing. <br>
                                Django and Flask are two common Python frameworks.</p>
<p>2.<b>Java: </b>Another well-liked programming language for creating backends is Java. <br>
    It has a reputation for being secure, scalable, and stable. Java is frequently used to create web services and enterprise-level applications. <br>
    The prominent Java frameworks are Spring and Hibernate.</p>
    <h1>Step 2: Understand Web Servers</h1>
    <p>Being a backend developer also requires understanding web servers. Software programs known as web servers provide a foundation for hosting and serving online applications.

        Almost 50% of all websites utilize the Apache web server, a well-liked open-source web server. It is renowned for its consistency, safety, and adaptability. 
        Web applications like content management systems (CMS) and e-commerce platforms employ Apache.
        
        Another well-liked open-source web server, Nginx, is renowned for its outstanding performance, scalability, and speed.

                <h1>Step 5: Deployment</h1>
                <p>Last step of backend roadmap is making a web application accessible to users on a live server viz known as deployment. The appropriate infrastructure must be set up, the server must be configured, and the code must be deployed to the server.

                    Here is a step-by-step guide to deploying a web application: <br>
                    
                    <b>Choose a hosting company:</b> Selecting a hosting company to host your application on a live server is the first step towards deployment. Several hosting companies are accessible, including AWS, Digital Ocean, and Heroku. <br>
                <b>Setup the server: </b>After deciding on a hosting company, you must set up the server so that your application can function. This includes setting up the database, installing the required dependencies, and configuring the server software, such as Apache or Nginx. <br>
                <b>Method:</b> A web application can be deployed in a variety of ways, such as using FTP, Git, or a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) tool. Pick a deployment strategy that suits your application the best. <br>
                <b>Create a production build:</b> You must first make a production build before deploying your application. This entails preparing the code for production, which includes generating any required assets and minifying JavaScript and CSS files. <br>
                <b> Code deployment: </b>After producing a production build, you can use the deployment mechanism of your choice to upload the code to the server. Files may need to be copied to the server, code may need to be pushed to a Git repository, or code changes may need to be automatically deployed using a CI/CD technology.</p> 
                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
