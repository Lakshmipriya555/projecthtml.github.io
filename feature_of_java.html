The popular programming language Java has been around for more than 20 years. 
Its popularity can be attributed to, among other things, its portability, security, and scalability.
Being a cross-platform language, its ability to function on several systems is one of the main factors in its appeal.
Java is an object-oriented language that also includes a robust type system and allows automatic memory management.
It is a powerful language for creating complex programmes thanks to its built-in support for multithreading and security features. 
In addition, Java features a simple syntax and a comprehensive API, making it simple to learn and use.<br>
Java is being used by more than 9 million developers around the world. 
It continues to be a widely used language in the software development industry thanks to its popularity and adaptability, 
which have made it a favourite among entrepreneurs and developers alike. <br>
Java includes a huge selection of libraries and frameworks that make it simpler for programmers to create sophisticated applications. 
There are many useful classes and functions in Java  standard library, a
nd additional libraries and frameworks streamline the development process while adding even more capability.

<h2>Features of Java</h2>
<dl>
    <dt><b>Platform independence: </b></dt>
    <dd>Java is a “write once, run anywhere” language, meaning that Java code can run without any changes
         on any platform that supports Java.</dd><br>
         <dt><b>Object-oriented language:</b></dt>
         <dd> Java is an object-oriented language that enables programmers to create modular,
             reusable code components known as objects, making it simpler to develop and maintain complex programmes.</dd><br>
             <dt><b>Automatic memory management: </b></dt>
             <dd>Java includes an automatic memory management mechanism that relieves developers of the need to manually 
                handle memory allocation and deallocation.</dd><br>
                <dt><b>Security:</b></dt>
                <dd> Java contains built-in security measures that can block unauthorised access and shield users from potential security risks. Java was created with security in mind.</dd><br>
                <dt><b>Rich API: </b></dt>
                <dd>The Java standard library has a sizable number of classes and methods, giving programmers a wide range of practical tools for creating applications.</dd><br>
                <dt><b>Multi-threading support:</b> </dt>
                <dd>Support for multithreading is integrated into Java, enabling programmers to create concurrent applications that can handle running several threads at once.</dd><br>
                <dt><b>High performance: </b></dt>
                <dd>Java is renowned for having a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, which optimises code execution while it is running.</dd><br>
                <dt><b>Scalability:</b></dt>
                <dd>Java modular architecture and object-oriented programming make it simpler to create large-scale programmes that can be scaled up or down based on demand.</dd><br>
                <dt><b>Simplified syntax:</b></dt>
                <dd>Java has a syntax that is simpler than other programming languages, making it simpler for developers to write and read code.</dd>
