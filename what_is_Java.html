        <h1>What is Java</h1>
        <p>Python is the programming language behind giant applications like 
            YouTube, Instagram, Spotify, Uber, Netflix, and many more apps.

But are you still wondering whether or not you should learn it? Should you add it to your knowledge stack?

 Direct answer- Yes! Learning it will assure you a great job, a high package, brilliant opportunities, 
                amazing communities, and a successful and fulfilling software development career.
            
 Python is a general-purpose, interpreted high-level software development language developed in 1991, 
yet recently gained popularity with the 3rd version of Python ( Python 3).

            <h1>Why was Python developed?</h1>
<p>Guido van Rossum, a software developer, got frustrated with the complex and tedious languages he was working with. 
Hence in the 1980s, he picked the project of developing a syntactically beautiful, simple, easy, and fun-to-use language. 
Fun! The name suggests that already. 
But to understand what made Python one of the most loved programming languages continue reading below.</p><br>
<h1>Features of Python Language</h1>
<p>Here are the 5 major reasons that make the Python language so popular with a 
    fan base calling themselves “Pythonistas”.</p>
    <h2>1.Python is beginner-friendly.</h2>
<p>Python features very closely with the English syntax and is super easy to read even by someone,not a coder. 
It uses fewer lines of code and simple rules with no semicolon at the end of every line or confusing brackets. 
For example, here as a simple code to print “Hello, world” implemented in C (right) and Python (left).
Python needs just one line
</p>
<h2>2. Python is Easy to Learn</h2>
<p>Python rules and syntax are very easy compared to other popular languages like C, C++, and Java. 
Another thing that makes Python simple is that it is an interpreted language. 
Interpreted language means when you write a program in C or C++, you write the complete code and then check for errors in the compiler. 
But with Python, you can check if your code is error-free in every line and correct if it is wrong.</p>
<h2>3. Python is highly versatile</h2>
<p>Python can be used for small projects, say making a calculator, 
and for big and complex tasks such as web development,
data analytics, etc. This is possible due to the pre-written codes you can use directly and build upon. 
These pre-written codes are called Python libraries and frameworks.</p>
<h2>4. Python is super flexible</h2>
<p>Python offers flexibility with the platform it is used upon. 
You can easily run the Python code you wrote on Windows over Linux or macOS without making any changes. 
Another exciting feature of Python is that it can run along with other programming languages 
such as Java (Jython) or C Language (CPython).</p>
<h2>5. Free and Open-Source</h2>
<p>Python is completely free to use, even for commercial purposes. 
It does not cost anything to download Python or to include it in your application.
It can also be freely modified and re-distributed. You can download Python from the official Python website.</p>
